# What We Do

At its core, Next-Cart provides a full-scale data migration service that transfers critical store data — including products, images, categories, customers, orders, blog posts and other custom data — from a Source Cart to a Target Cart that matches a merchant’s current and future platforms.

The migration solution is:

#### Expert-handled from A to Z

The process is powered by automated tools but managed step by step by Next-Cart specialists, who monitor, troubleshoot, and fine-tune the migration.

#### Cloud-based and installation-free

The migration engine runs on secure cloud servers located in the US, UK, and Singapore, so merchants do not need to install software on their own infrastructure.

#### Web-based and easy to operate

The tool is delivered as a web application with a guided, three-step workflow, designed to be usable even by non-technical store owners while still exposing enough control for developers and agencies.

#### Flexible in data sources

Beyond live store-to-store migrations, Next-Cart can also handle imports from CSV, XML, XLS, SQL, and data feeds, as well as data stored by third-party extensions, through dedicated services and custom migration work.

Next-Cart currently supports migrations across 80+ eCommerce platforms and related systems, including major shopping carts, CMSs, and marketplace-style platforms, with the ability to add new platforms or custom carts on request.
