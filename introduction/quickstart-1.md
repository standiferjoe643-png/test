# Our Story

Next-Cart was founded by a team of experts with extensive experience in eCommerce services and data migration, having completed migration projects on platforms such as Magento (Adobe Commerce), WordPress, WooCommerce, Shopify, BigCommerce, and many others.

Working with more than 15,000+ clients over the years, the team saw recurring issues across the industry: data security concerns, inconsistent migration quality, and slow or inefficient support — often as a side effect of large-scale providers prioritizing volume and profit over individual customer experience.

Next-Cart was created to address these problems directly. The service combines an optimized migration application with hands-on technical assistance, aiming to ensure that each migration is supervised, adjusted, and completed only when the customer is satisfied with the result.
