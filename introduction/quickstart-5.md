# Why Choose Next-Cart

From the customer perspective, a few characteristics commonly define Next-Cart’s value:

#### No downtime during migration

The migration process is designed so that the source store continues operating normally while data is being copied.

#### No deep technical skills required

The guided workflow minimizes technical complexity for non-technical users, while advanced options remain available for developers.

#### Professional, 24/7/365 support

1:1 technical support is available throughout the migration, including weekends and holidays, until the customer is satisfied with the result.

#### Customizable and extensible

Migrations can be tailored to include custom fields, third-party extension data, and non-standard structures, supported by additional services called “Custom Job”.

#### Focus on SEO and data integrity

The tools are built to preserve key SEO elements such as URLs and metadata and to maintain relationships between entities (e.g., orders linked to customers and products).

#### Transparent, competitive pricing with guarantees

Pricing is based on an Entity Limit model and backed by a 30-day money-back guarantee and a commitment to remain competitively priced among migration providers.

Together, these elements position Next-Cart as a specialist provider: not just a generic data-moving utility, but a focused partner for re-platforming projects, where data quality, security, and support are central to the outcome.
