# Scale and Track Record

Since its founding, Next-Cart has:

* Migrated more than **125,000+ websites**,
* Supported over **80+ eCommerce platforms**, and
* Built partnerships with **several well-known e-Commerce service providers**,
* While serving **thousands of customers worldwide** across SMEs, online retailers, and web development agencies.

These milestones reflect both the maturity of the migration engine and the emphasis on long-term support relationships with developers, agencies, and merchants who handle migrations repeatedly as part of their work.
