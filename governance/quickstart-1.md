# Privacy & GDPR Compliance

#### Roles Under GDPR

* **You (the merchant / agency) are the Data Controller.**
  * You decide which customer data to collect, how it is used in your store, and when to request a migration.
* **Next-Cart acts as a Data Processor.**
  * It processes personal data (e.g., customer accounts, order history) only to perform the migration and provide support, on your documented instructions.
  * Next-Cart is GDPR compliant and does not sell or re-purpose your customer data for marketing.

#### What Data Next-Cart Collects

1. **Cookies and Site Interaction Data**

* IP address, browser type/version, strictly necessary cookies, and performance/targeting cookies (where consented).
* Used to operate the website, improve user experience, and understand service usage.

2. **Account & Registration Data**

* Email and password (required); optional name, phone, country, and other profile information.
* Order/billing history for compliance and accounting purposes.
* Used to create, secure, and manage your Next-Cart account.

3. **Store Data for Migration**

* Store URLs, API keys / tokens, KitConnect endpoint URLs, and occasionally exports or database connection details.
* E-commerce data from the Source Store required for migration: products, categories, customers, orders, coupons, CMS pages, etc.

4. **Support Credentials**

* Temporary access credentials for admin panels, hosting control panels, or SFTP/SSH, provided by you when needed.
* Technical logs and error traces generated by the migration tool and support investigations.

#### How Data is Collected & Used

Data is collected when you: register, place an order, use the migration service, contact support, interact with the website, or send credentials for troubleshooting.

Main purposes include:

* Providing and maintaining the migration service.
* Managing your account and authentication.
* Handling orders, invoicing, and customer support.
* Improving the platform (analytics, performance tuning, UX).
* Handling disputes, fraud prevention, and legal compliance.
* Sending operational communications and, where you consent, limited marketing.

Next-Cart **does not share, sell, or lease** personal information to third parties for their own marketing. Data may still be shared with infrastructure providers or when required by law.

#### Data Subject Rights

Under GDPR, users have specific rights, which Next-Cart acknowledges in its Privacy Policy:

* Right of access (get a copy of your personal data).
* Right to rectification (correct inaccurate or incomplete data).
* Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”), under certain conditions.
* Right to restrict processing, object to processing, and data portability.
* Right to withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.

Next-Cart will respond to such requests **within one month**. Submit a request via a contact form or by contacting support.

#### Data Storage, Protection, and Retention

* **Store data for migrations (products, customers, orders)** is stored only as long as necessary to:
  * Run your Demo, Full, and Recent Data Migrations.
  * Complete troubleshooting during the support window.
* After your migration is complete and the defined support window closes, **sensitive store data is automatically and permanently deleted** from Next-Cart’s systems.
* Only essential **account and billing information** is retained, as required for legal and tax purposes.

This means:

* Your store data is not kept as a long-term asset.
* You can additionally revoke access yourself at any time by:
  * Deleting API keys / tokens from your SaaS stores.
  * Deleting the KitConnect folder from your server.
  * Changing any temporary admin or SFTP passwords you shared.

#### International Transfers & Security Measures

* Data is processed on secure cloud servers located in regions such as the US, UK, and Singapore, using encrypted channels (HTTPS, SFTP, secure APIs).
* Next-Cart applies “appropriate technical and organizational measures” to protect personal data, including:
  * SSL/TLS encryption for web interactions.
  * Controlled access to production systems.
  * Internal procedures for handling credentials and store access.
* Users are advised to always use secure methods (e.g., SFTP, HTTPS) for file transfers and to keep their local systems and passwords secure.

For merchants operating under specific regional regulations, you should review the official Privacy Policy and consult your own legal counsel to confirm how these measures align with your compliance requirements.
