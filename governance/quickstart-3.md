# Refund Policy

#### Overview & Time Window

* You have 30 days from the purchase date to request a refund for a migration tool or service.
* All refund requests must comply with the conditions defined in the policy.
* Refunds are not designed as a “change of mind” guarantee; they are tied to technical issues or failure to meet commitments, not to dissatisfaction with a chosen platform.

#### Conditions for a Full Refund (100%)

A full 100% refund is available if **all** of the following apply:

* There are **major technical issues** with the migrated data.
* These issues have been **verified and confirmed** by Next-Cart engineers.
* They **cannot be resolved within 72 hours** of the first customer report, excluding:
  * Cases caused by inherent limitations of the shopping cart platforms, or
  * Situations outside Next-Cart’s control.

Additionally, Next-Cart may provide a full refund if there are clear **violations of commitments** made by technicians during service delivery (for example, a specific scope that was promised but technically feasible and not delivered).

#### Partial Refunds (Up to 50%)

When a migration has been **“considerably completed”** and significant computing resources have already been consumed, only a **partial refund of up to 50%** may be granted.

This typically applies when:

* A large Full Migration has already run.
* Some issues remain unresolved but a substantial part of the work has been successfully executed.

The exact percentage and outcome are determined case-by-case, based on the extent of work performed and the nature of the technical issues.

#### Non-Refundable Cases

The Refund Policy and Terms of Service list specific cases where refunds are **not** available:

*   **Violations of the Terms of Service**

    * If the customer breaches the Terms (e.g., misuse of the service, abusive behaviour, security violations), fees are not refundable.


*   **Additional labour-based technical services**

    * Certain add-on services performed by technical engineers are non-refundable once work has started, because their value lies in time and expertise already spent.


* **Platform limitations or external constraints**
  * If an issue is caused by inherent limitations or bugs in the Source or Target platform (e.g., variant limits, missing features that no migration tool can overcome), this is not grounds for a refund.<br>
* **Change of mind or platform regret**
  * Successfully completing a migration and then deciding that you no longer want to use the chosen Target platform is not covered by the refund policy.

#### How to Request a Refund

1. **Submit the request**

* Go to the Contact page and choose the “Request a Refund” form, or start via Live Chat.
* Provide details about your order, project, and the technical issue.<br>

2. **Review & decision**

* The team reviews your case and aims to respond within **2 working days**.
* You are informed whether the request is approved (full, partial) or declined, with explanation where possible.<br>

3. **Refund execution & license status**

* If approved, the refund is issued via your original payment method (e.g., card, payment gateway).
* The migration license is then disabled, and Next-Cart stops all activity related to that migration.

#### Role of the Free Demo Migration

The Free Demo Migration is an important part of the overall risk-management model:

*   The Demo will:

    * Tests connections and credentials.
    * Shows how your core data will look on the Target platform.
    * Allows you to verify mapping, SEO, and relationships on a small sample.


* Because of this, the refund policy is not designed for “try a full migration, then change your mind.” It is designed for:
  * Genuine technical failures, and
  * Rare cases where issues cannot be fixed within the stated timeframe despite full cooperation.
