# Terms of Service

#### How the Service Relationship Works

* When you create a Next-Cart account and use the migration service, you enter into an agreement governed by:
  * The **Terms of Service**
  * The **Privacy Policy** and **Data Policy**
  * The **Refund Policy**
* You must read and agree to these before purchasing or using any migration service; using the service implies acceptance.
* Next-Cart can update its Terms over time. If the Terms change, customers keep the benefit of the **older version for a short grace period** after purchase (typically 30 days), after which new Terms apply to future use.

#### Scope of the Migration Service

Next-Cart provides:

* A **cloud-based migration engine and dashboard** that connects your Source and Target stores and transfers supported data entities (products, categories, customers, orders, CMS/blog posts, and related SEO data).
* **Three main service modes built on the same engine:**
  * **Standard Migration** – you operate the tool yourself with 1-year technical support included.
  * **Managed Migration** – Next-Cart’s technicians operate the standard tool for you, end-to-end, using your configuration and requirements.
  * **Custom Migration** – Managed Migration plus custom scripting, handling of non-standard data sources or extensions, and deeper engineering work.
* **One license per project/store pair**
  * A license is tied to a specific Source Store (or Target Store, depending on the migration type) and corresponding carts.
  * Within that license, you can perform **multiple migrations** (Demo, Full, Recent Data Migration) as long as you stay within your plan’s Entity Points and license term.
* **License duration**
  * A migration license is valid for 12 months from purchase. During this period, you may run migrations, re-migrations, and Recent Data Migrations as needed.

#### User Obligations & Acceptable Use

According to the Terms of Service, you agree to:

* **Use the service lawfully**
  * Do not change, modify, hack, or fake the service.
  * &#x20;Do not use the service to distribute malicious code, spam, or any content that violates applicable laws.
* **Respect service ownership & licensing**
  * You may not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, or exploit any portion of the service without written permission.
  * You may not use the service through unofficial channels or fake/impersonating sites.
* **Protect credentials**
  * You must provide accurate registration information and keep your account credentials confidential.
  * Next-Cart is not responsible for loss or damage caused by compromised accounts where security failures originate on your side.
* **Grant appropriate access for migration**
  * When you provide site credentials (admin, API, KitConnect, FTP/SFTP, hosting), you authorize Next-Cart to log in, view, and adjust settings **only to the extent needed** to perform the migration and make the store compatible with the service.
* **Report serious issues**
  * If you discover a defect that affects migration accuracy or security, you must notify Next-Cart so it can investigate and fix the problem. Failing to report may limit responsibility for downstream issues.

Next-Cart may suspend or terminate an account, and delete or deactivate related content, if it detects abuse, security risks, violations of the Terms, or behaviour that harms the service or other users.

#### Account & Support Terms

* **Account responsibilities**
  * Provide accurate registration information (email and required details).
  * Keep login details confidential and update them if compromised.
  * Next-Cart can suspend or terminate accounts for abuse, security risks, or repeated violations.
* **Support scope**
  * Included support: helping you connect stores, configure migrations, run Demo/Full/Recent Data migrations, and fix issues that arise from the migration tool itself.
  * Excluded support (unless covered by Custom Migration/Custom Job): deep server reconfiguration, fixing unrelated hosting issues, rewriting third-party extensions, or building entirely new integrations.
* **Support timing**
  * Technical support is available via ticket, email, and live chat, with a target response time (often within 24 hours) and defined windows for investigations or bug fixes.

#### Migration Terms & Limitations

The Migration Terms in the ToS set expectations around what migration can and cannot do:

* **Source & Target binding**
  * For cart-to-cart migrations, the license is tied to the first Source Store domain you use.
  * For file/API-to-cart migrations, the license is tied to the Target Store domain.
* **What is guaranteed**
  * Migration of supported entities that exist natively on both platforms (e.g., products, categories, customers, orders, basic SEO metadata).
  * Use of secure connection methods (API, KitConnect, SFTP) that are read-only on the Source Store side.
* **What is not guaranteed by default**
  * Automatic migration of non-standard custom fields, third-party extension data, or bespoke database structures. These may require a Custom Migration / Custom Job engagement.
  * Preservation of features the Target platform simply does not support (e.g., platform-specific product types or SEO options).
* **Operational recommendations**
  * Use maintenance mode on the Target Store during large Full Migrations when possible.
  * Never run more than one Full Migration into the same Target Store at the same time to avoid duplication and conflicts.
  * Always run a Free Demo Migration before purchasing or running a full-scale migration.

#### Payment & Plan Model

* **Currency & billing**
  * Prices are listed in USD and migration services are billed upfront.
* **Plan capacity**
  * Each plan includes a number of Entity Points that represent your total data volume (e.g., products, customers, orders, and related records).
  * If a project exceeds 1,024,000 Entity Points, an additional fee of $50 per extra 100,000 Entity Points is charged, as you outlined.
* **License duration**
  * A paid license gives you up to one year of usage and support, including migrations and Recent Data Migrations within your Entity Points.
  * You will recieve an **extra 1-month license** when you upgrade to a higher plan, starting from the upgrade purchase time.

For the conditions under which payments are refundable, see the “Refund Policy & Money-Back Guarantee” page.
