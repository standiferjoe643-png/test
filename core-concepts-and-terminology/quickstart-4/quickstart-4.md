# Custom Migration

In addition to full-data moves, Next-Cart supports selective migration, such as:

* Migrating only specific entities (e.g., only products and categories).
* Migrating entities filtered by date range (e.g., last 6 months of orders).
* Migrating specific catalog segments.
* Special modifications request.

This is useful for large or long-lived stores where full historical data is not required in the new system.
