# Full Migration

A Full Migration is the complete, paid migration of your store data:

* Moves all selected entity types at full scale.
* Runs in the background; you can close your browser while it processes.
* Includes advanced options like preserving order IDs, creating URL redirects, stripping HTML, and mapping statuses and customer groups.

All full migrations are covered by **1-year support**, which includes re-runs, support, and compatibility updates within the service scope.
