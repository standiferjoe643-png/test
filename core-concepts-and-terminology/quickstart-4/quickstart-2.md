# Re-migration

Next-Cart allows you to re-run the migration between the same Source and Target within your service window:

* To adjust settings (e.g., mapping, filters).
* To correct earlier misconfigurations.
* To refresh data after further Target Store configuration.

Re-migrations are governed by your Entity Points and service plan; they are **repeatable full migrations**.
