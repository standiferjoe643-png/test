# Migration Types & Lifecycle

A store migration is not just a single transfer of data; it is a sequence of controlled stages that take you from your current platform to a new one while your business continues to operate. This section introduces the overall **migration lifecycle** used by Next-Cart and the main migration types that appear within it.

Looking at your project through this lifecycle makes it easier to understand where you are, what comes next, and what each stage is supposed to achieve. It also provides a neutral framework for comparing different service options and timelines, so that technical teams, store owners, and the Next-Cart specialists can coordinate around the same process, rather than treating each migration as a one-off event.
