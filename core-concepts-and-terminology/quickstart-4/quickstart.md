# Demo Migration

A Demo Migration is a limited, **free “test drive”** of the full service.

* Migrates a small, fixed sample of your data (10 entities for each Data).
* Preserves relationships (e.g., orders linked to customers, products linked to categories).
* Runs with real connections (API / KitConnect) and real data structure.

Its main purpose:

* Confirm your **connections** work (API keys, KitConnect, firewalls).
* Show you **exactly how your data will look** on the Target Store before you pay.
* Highlight any **custom data** that will need a Custom Migration or customization step.
