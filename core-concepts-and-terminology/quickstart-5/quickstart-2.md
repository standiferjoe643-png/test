# FTP/SFTP & File Manager

For certain operations (e.g., uploading KitConnect or working with file-based migrations), Next-Cart uses **FTP**/**SFTP** or hosting file managers:

* **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** – A traditional method of transferring files between your computer and your server.
* **SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)** – A modern, encrypted version that should always be preferred for security.

Recommended tools:

* FileZilla, Cyberduck, and WinSCP – user-friendly FTP/SFTP clients that make uploading KitConnect or other files simple and reliable.
