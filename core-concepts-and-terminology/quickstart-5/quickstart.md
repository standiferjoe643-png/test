# API Connection

For hosted/SaaS platforms like Shopify, BigCommerce, or Squarespace, Next-Cart connects via the platform’s official API.

* You generate API Keys / Access Tokens in your store’s admin or developer portal.
* Permissions are typically read-only for data such as products, orders, and customers.
* API connections use HTTPS for secure data transfer.

This method ensures your migration complies with platform policies and maintains strict access control.
