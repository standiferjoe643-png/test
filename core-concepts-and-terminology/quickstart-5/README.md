# Connection Methods

Every migration begins with the question of how Next-Cart will connect to your stores in a safe and reliable way. This section introduces the main **connection methods** that can be used for different platforms and explains their role at a conceptual level.

There are three connection concepts:

* API Connection – mainly for hosted/SaaS platforms.
* KitConnect Bridge Script – for open-source platforms.
* File-based / FTP Access – for file uploads, exports, or specific hosting environments.

The aim here is not to walk through every technical step, but to give you a clear, non-ambiguous understanding of what “connecting a store” actually means and what is expected from your side. With that context, the more detailed connection guides and troubleshooting articles become easier to follow, and you can make informed decisions about access, security, and who in your team should be involved.
