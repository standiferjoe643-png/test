# Supporting Data Structures

Next-Cart also migrates a wide range of supporting entities, such as:

* **Categories & subcategories** – Your catalog taxonomy.
* **Manufacturers**/**Brands** – Brand-level grouping and filters.
* **Product attributes & options** – Sizes, colors, materials, etc.
* **Product images & galleries** – Primary images and additional galleries.
* **Product reviews & ratings** – Social proof and customer feedback.
* **Coupons & discounts** – Promotional rules and codes.
* **Blog posts & CMS pages** – Content pages, FAQs, landing pages.
* **URL structure & redirects** – SEO URLs and redirect rules (301/302).
* **Taxes & tax rules** – Tax classes, rules, and zones.
* **Customer groups** – Wholesale, VIP, B2B segments.

These entities preserve your store structure, user experience, and SEO authority rather than just raw transactional data.
