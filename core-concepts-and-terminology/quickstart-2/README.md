# E-Commerce Data & Entity Types

E-commerce data is the information that describes your online business: what you sell, who your customers are, how orders are placed, and how content and SEO support that activity. This section introduces how Next-Cart thinks about that information at a structural level, using **entities** to represent the building blocks of your store in a consistent and migration-friendly way.

By understanding entities and how they relate to each other, you gain a clearer view of what is actually being moved during a migration and why some parts of your data matter more for planning than others. The concepts in this section provide the foundation for later topics such as data compatibility, Entity Points, and migration scope, and help both business and technical stakeholders speak the same language when discussing “your data”.
