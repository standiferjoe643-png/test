# The “Big 4” Entities

For sizing and planning, the most important entities are:&#x20;

* **Products** – Individual items you sell (including variants).
* **Customers** – Accounts and profiles of people who buy from you.
* **Orders** – Completed and in-progress transactions with full order history.
* **Blog Posts / Articles** – Content that drives SEO and engagement.

These “Big 4” are key drivers of Entity Points and are central to accurate cost estimation and performance planning.
