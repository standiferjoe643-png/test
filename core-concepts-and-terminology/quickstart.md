# Re-platforming vs. Shopping Cart Migration

**Re-platforming** means moving your online store from one e-commerce platform to another, usually to unlock better performance, features, or scalability.

Re-platforming is a business decision: it is about where your store will live and how it will grow in the next 3–5 years.

**Shopping cart migration** is the technical data move inside that re-platforming project.

It focuses on reliably copying your e-commerce data from your Source Store to your Target Store without disrupting your business.

In the Next-Cart ecosystem:

* **Re-platforming** is about where your store runs (hosting, platform, tech stack).
* **Shopping Cart Migration** is about what gets moved (data) and how it is copied safely.

Next-Cart focuses on data migration: ensuring the data that powers your business moves over cleanly, without breaking connections or causing downtime.
