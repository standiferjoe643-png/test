# How Entity Points Are Used

Entity Points are used to:

* Estimate your migration size and recommend a suitable plan.
* Determine the maximum safe volume for a single migration run.
* Help support engineers understand the complexity of your case.

They are not used to artificially block your business; they’re a technical tool to keep migrations efficient, safe, and predictable.
