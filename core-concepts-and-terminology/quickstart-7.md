# SEO & Content Concepts

Migration must preserve not only data but also your search visibility and content architecture.

Key SEO-related concepts in the Next-Cart ecosystem:

* **Blog posts & CMS pages** – valuable for inbound traffic; migrated to equivalent structures on the Target Store.
* **301 redirects** – permanent redirects telling search engines that a page has moved; essential for preserving SEO equity.
* **302 redirects** – temporary redirects; used sparingly to avoid SEO confusion.
* **URL Redirects** – broader rules or mappings that redirect old URLs to new paths on the Target Store.

Next-Cart supports creating redirects as part of the migration configuration, particularly when the Target platform generates different URL patterns.
