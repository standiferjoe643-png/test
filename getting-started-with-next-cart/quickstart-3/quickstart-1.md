# Understand the Per-Run Model & Upgrades

Your Entity Points plan is a l**imit per individual migration run, not a global pool**.

* You **do not** need a new plan each time you run a migration.
* You **only need** to upgrade if a single run (e.g. Full Migration or one Recent Data Migration) exceeds your plan’s Entity Points.

If your plan exceeds **1,024,000 Entity Points**, we will charge an additional **$50 for each extra 100,000 Entity Points**.

When you upgrade:

* Your Entity Points limit for the affected run increases.
* You typically receive an extra month of license as a bonus for the upgrade.
