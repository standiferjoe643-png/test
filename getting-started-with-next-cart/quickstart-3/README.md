# Choosing a Plan

After you understand your store’s data and the general shape of the migration, you need a way to translate that into a concrete plan and budget. This section explains the idea behind **Entity Points** and how they are used to express the size of a migration run in a way that is both technically meaningful and easy to reason about when selecting a plan.

Rather than focusing on specific prices or tables, the emphasis here is on how to think about scale, complexity, and service level. By the time you finish this section, you should have a clear conceptual model for why different stores require different plan levels, how those levels relate to the work being done, and how your choice connects back to the preparation and lifecycle concepts introduced earlier in the documentation.
