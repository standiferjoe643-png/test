# Account Dashboard

#### Access Your Account Dashboard

To open the dashboard:

* Sign up for a Next-Cart account using your business email, or log in if you already have one.
* Verify your email address if prompted.
* After logging in, you are taken to your **Account Overview**, which serves as the home screen for your dashboard.

From here, you can either start with a **Free Demo Migration** or proceed directly to configuring a full migration or discussing a Managed/Custom project with the team.

#### Account Overview

**Account Overview** is the “homepage” of your account. It provides a concise snapshot of your current relationship with Next-Cart.

Typical information includes:

* **Recent activity** – recent logins, migrations you’ve run, or key actions.
* **Migration status at a glance** – a quick view to confirm that your Demo and Full migrations have completed successfully.
* **Support status** – a count or summary of open support tickets, helping you see if any issues are still being investigated.

This area is designed to answer the question: _“Is everything on track right now?”_ without requiring you to open multiple sub-pages.

#### My Licenses / My Services

The **My Licenses / My Services** section shows exactly which services and plans are active for your account. It acts as your “source of truth” for what you have purchased and what you are entitled to use.

You will typically see:

* Your active **Standard Migration** plans.
* Any **Managed Migration** or **Custom Migration** packages associated with your projects.
* Any additional add-ons or modules that belong to your account (for example, platform-specific connectors or extra utilities).

When you need to confirm whether a particular migration project is covered, this is the first place to check.

#### Migration Tool Management

**Migration Tool Management** is your operational control centre. This is where you configure, start, and monitor your actual data migrations.

From this section, you can:

* **Start a new migration**
  * Create a migration project for a specific Source → Target platform pair.
  * Configure connection details (API, KitConnect, or file-based) and select which entities to migrate.
* **View migration history**
  * Check the list of Demo, Full, and Recent Data Migrations that have been run for this project.
  * See the status of each run (e.g. completed, in progress, failed) and access logs or reports where provided.
* **Run additional migrations**
  * **Re-run a Full Migration (Remigration)** if you need to change settings and try again.
  * Run **Recent Data Migration** to bring across only the new data generated since your last full run.
* **Download modules or extensions**
  * If your plan includes specific add-ons or connectors, the download links are usually available here.

If you see messages related to **Entity Points** being exceeded for a run, you will typically handle the upgrade from this area or from the linked license view.

#### Billing & Invoices

The **Billing & Invoices** section is where you manage your financial records with Next-Cart. It is particularly useful for accounting, procurement, or finance teams who need clear documentation of what has been purchased.

Here you can:

* View your **payment history** for migration tools and services.
* **Download invoices** for bookkeeping and tax purposes.
* Confirm charges related to **plan upgrades** when your Entity Points requirements change.

This section ties directly into your internal budget tracking and helps keep migration spending transparent.

#### My Tickets

**My Tickets** is your private support helpdesk workspace. It provides a structured way to communicate with Next-Cart’s 24/7 technical support team and track all historical conversations.

You can:

* **Submit a new ticket** when you encounter errors, have configuration questions, or need a technician to review your results.
* **Monitor open tickets** to see which issues are under investigation and what the latest responses are.
* **Review closed tickets** to look back at previous resolutions and explanations.

For Managed and Custom Migration projects, this ticket area often becomes your main communication channel with the project team, including sharing requirements, clarifications, and sign-off.

#### Account Details

**Account Details** is the settings area for your user profile. It focuses on identity and access rather than migration content.

In this section, you can:

* Update your **login email** and basic profile information.
* Change your **password** or security details.
* Keep your contact information current so that support can reach you reliably.

These settings help maintain account security and ensure important notifications reach the right people on your team.

#### Using the Dashboard as Your Migration Hub

Once you are familiar with these six areas, the Account Dashboard becomes a single, predictable entry point for everything related to your migration:

* **Planning and configuration** – via My Licenses / My Services and Migration Tool Management.
* **Financial tracking** – via Billing & Invoices.
* **Issue resolution and communication** – via My Tickets and the integrated support flow.

If you are just getting started, a typical workflow is:

1. Create your account and access the dashboard.
2. Run a **Free Demo Migration** from Migration Tool Management.
3. Review the results, choose a plan, and run your Full Migration.
4. Use **Recent Data Migration** before go-live.
5. Use **My Tickets** whenever you need assistance.
