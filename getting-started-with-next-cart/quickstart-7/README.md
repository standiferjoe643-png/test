# Dashboard Basics

Once you are ready to work with Next-Cart, your Account Dashboard becomes the operational home for your entire migration project. It brings together your active migration plans, your migration tools, and your support touchpoints in one secure place, so you can see where each project stands without digging through emails or multiple admin panels.

From this central hub, you start and monitor migrations, access required connectors or modules, manage billing and invoices, and communicate directly with the 24/7 technical support team as your store moves from demo to full migration and then to go-live.
