# Step 5: Review the Demo Results

Once the demo completes, log in to your target store and inspect:

#### **Products**

* Did the names, descriptions, and prices transfer correctly?
* Are product images present (main image, gallery, in-description images)?
* Are product options/variants (sizes, colors, etc.) mapped and usable?

#### **Categories / Collections**

* Does your category hierarchy (parent/child) appear correctly? Product Categories & Subcategor…
* Are demo products assigned to the expected categories or Shopify collections?

#### **Customers & Orders**

* Are demo customers created with the correct contact information?
* Is order history linked to the appropriate customers and products?

#### **Content & SEO-relevant pages**

* Are blog posts and critical CMS pages present?
* Check URLs and basic meta data if SEO is business-critical.

***

Any gap you find here is either:

* A **mapping adjustment** (handled via configuration or attribute mapping), or
* A **Custom Migration requirement** (e.g., third-party app data, highly custom fields).
