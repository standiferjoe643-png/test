# Step 6: Plan Your Go-Live

Once you are satisfied with the demo, you can plan the full migration and cut-over.

We recommend:

* Pick a **low-traffic window** (e.g., late night in your core market).
* Freeze non-critical content changes on the source store near go-live.
* Prepare a **checklist for post-migration verification.**
