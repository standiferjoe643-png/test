# The Pre-Migration Checklist

Good migrations are planned, not improvised. The Pre-Migration Checklist exists to turn preparation into a defined sequence of activities instead of a loose collection of tips, helping you clarify what needs to be done before the first full run of data. This section introduces the checklist and explains why each stage of preparation matters for the quality and safety of your migration.

Seen from this perspective, the checklist is less about ticking boxes and more about aligning expectations: what data will move, what the new store should look like before migration, how you will verify results, and when you are ready to switch over. It functions as a common reference for everyone involved—owners, project leads, developers, and Next-Cart’s team—so that decisions about timing and risk are based on the same underlying steps.
