# Step 2: Choose and Prepare Your Target Store

You must have a **destination that is ready to receive data**.

#### **Choose the right platform**

Consider:

* SaaS (Shopify, BigCommerce, SHOPLINE, etc.) vs Open Source (WooCommerce, Magento, etc.)
* Built-in capabilities (e.g., BigCommerce customer groups, Shopify’s new 2,048-variant limit)
* App ecosystem and long-term TCO

Next-Cart’s **platform handbooks** give bias-free overviews of each platform’s structure and migration considerations.

#### **Install a clean target store**

* Fresh installation of the target platform (no test orders or demo products if possible).
* Admin access confirmed (you can log in & manage all settings).
* Default or simple theme is active.

#### **Delay heavy design work**

We strongly recommend **migrating data before heavy theming**:

* Use a clean default theme.
* Validate data & structure first.
* Apply final theme and UX tweaks **after** the migration.

This makes it easier to spot data issues (missing fields, broken images, category mis-mapping).
