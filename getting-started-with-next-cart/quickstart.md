# Before You Begin: Prerequisites & Mindset

A successful migration is **much more than pressing “Start”**. The quality of your result is determined by:

1. **How well your current store is audited**
2. **How ready your new target store is**
3. **How clearly you’ve defined scope and expectations**

Based on Next-Cart’s experience and migration best practices, we recommend adopting this mindset: plan like a **system upgrade**, not a “quick import”.

**Who Should Read This Section**

* **Store owners/founders** – to understand the steps, risks, and decisions.
* **eCommerce managers/project leads** – to coordinate roles, timelines and approvals.
* **Developers/technical admins** – to prepare infrastructure, credentials, backups.
* **Agencies/consultants** – to align expectations and scope with your client.

If you use **Managed** or **Custom Migration**, Next-Cart’s team will handle more of the execution, but **you still need this overview** to make informed decisions and validate the final result.
