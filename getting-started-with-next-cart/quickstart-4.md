# Decide Migration Service After Your Demo

At this stage, you have:

* Confirmed connectivity (API / KitConnect working)
* Verified a real data sample on your target platform
* Calculated your Entity Points and identified special data requirements

You can now make a data-driven choice:

#### Standard Migration

* Good if your store relies mostly on native platform features.
* You are comfortable running the migration tool yourself, with 24/7 technical support available if you get stuck.

#### Managed Migration

* Best if you want Next-Cart’s team to plan, configure, and run the migration for you, while you focus on business.
* Particularly suitable for stores with multiple stakeholders and strict timelines.

#### Custom Migration

* Required when you have significant custom data (plugins, third-party apps, complex attributes) that cannot be migrated by default.
* Necessary when you need to customize the migration tool with specific modifications to meet your requirements.
* Combines the advantages of Managed Migration with bespoke scripts, mappings, and additional consulting.
