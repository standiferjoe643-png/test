# About Next-Cart

Next-Cart is a specialized shopping cart migration service and toolset that helps online merchants move their stores between eCommerce platforms with accuracy, safety, and minimal disruption.

Since 2014, the team has focused on one core problem: making eCommerce re-platforming and data migration reliable, non-technical, and fully supported, so merchants and agencies can focus on growing their business rather than wrestling with data.
