# Who Standard Migration Is For

Standard Migration is usually the best fit if:

* You or your team can follow detailed technical instructions and operate the migration tool.
* Your data is mostly native to the platforms (minimal plugin-specific data).
* You want full control of timing and configuration, with support on standby if something goes wrong.
