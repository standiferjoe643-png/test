# Standard Migration

Standard Migration is Next-Cart’s core “DIY plus expert support” service. It gives you full access to the migration tool and all standard features, while the Next-Cart team is available 24/7 to answer questions, troubleshoot errors, and guide you through each step.

You are responsible for:

* Connecting your Source Store and Target Store.
* Selecting entities and configuration options in the migration wizard.
* Starting and monitoring your Demo and Full migrations (though they run in the background).

Next-Cart is responsible for:

* Providing and maintaining the migration tool.
* Ensuring secure connections (API, KitConnect, SFTP).
* Offering 1:1 technical support and guidance from setup through go-live.
