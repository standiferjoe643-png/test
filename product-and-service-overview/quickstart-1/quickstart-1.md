# What Standard Migration Does Not Include

Standard Migration does not include:

* Custom scripts to handle data from third-party plugins or external systems.
* Deep restructuring of data beyond what the standard tool supports.
* Done-for-you configuration and execution.

If your store relies heavily on extensions (e.g., loyalty programs, advanced review apps, or complex product option plugins), you’ll likely need Custom Migration for those specific data pieces.
