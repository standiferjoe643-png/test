# Assurances & Support

Across all three services, Next-Cart provides the same core guarantees:

* **No downtime on your live store** – Source and Target stores continue to operate while data is being copied.
* **1-year migration assurance** – You can re-run migrations and Recent Data Migration as needed within 12 months, using the same Source and Target.
* **24/7/365 support** – Email/Helpdesk/Live Chat assistance until you are satisfied with the final result.
* **Data security** – Migrations run via secure APIs, KitConnect, and encrypted protocols; only data necessary for the migration is processed.

What changes between Standard, Managed, and Custom is **who operates the tool** and **whether custom logic** **is implemented**, not the underlying guarantees of uptime, support, and data integrity.
