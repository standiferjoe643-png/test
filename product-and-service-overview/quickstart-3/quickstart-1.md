# What Custom Migration Does Not Include

Custom Migration focuses on **data**, not on replicating all code or design:

* It **does not** migrate the codebase of plugins or apps (functionality); it migrates the data from those plugins into equivalent structures on the new platform.
* It **does not** replace a full development project for redesigning themes or building new features; instead, it ensures that data is in the right place for your new apps and theme to use.
