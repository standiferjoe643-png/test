# Who Custom Migration Is For

Custom Migration is recommended when:

* Your business depends on **third-party plugins or advanced apps** whose data must survive the migration.
* You have **complex catalog or pricing logic** (B2B pricing tiers, multi-store setups, advanced tax rules).
* You want a **fully done-for-you** project, including scoping, custom scripts, and validation, handled by a specialist team.
