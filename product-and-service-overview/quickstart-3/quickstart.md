# What Custom Migration Includes

Custom Migration includes:

#### All benefits of Standard and Managed Migration

* Full coverage of native entities (products, customers, orders, taxes, etc.).
* 24/7/365 support throughout the project.
* Demo → Full → Recent Data Migration workflow.

#### Custom Jobs for non-standard data, including, for example:

* **Plugin/extension data**
  * Loyalty points stored in a loyalty app.
  * Advanced product options (engraving text, file uploads, custom checkboxes).
  * Third-party review apps (e.g., Yotpo, Loox).
* **External data sources**
  * CSV, XML, XLS, or SQL exports from legacy systems.
  * Marketplace or ERP exports (e.g., QuickBooks, POS systems), where supported.
* **Digital & special products**
  * Digital downloads, subscriptions, gift cards, and their associated rules.
* **Advanced mapping & transformation**
  * Mapping plugin-specific tables to metafields or custom attributes on the Target Store.
  * Re-linking complex relationships between entities that go beyond the standard model.

#### **Consultative scoping and quoting**

* You submit a ticket with a clear list of requirements (e.g. “Migrate my Yotpo reviews”, “Move loyalty points”, “Import CSV data from my old ERP”).
* Next-Cart’s experts analyze your stores, plugins, and data sources.
* You receive a Custom Job quote, usually calculated per request, with flexibility for complex scenarios.

#### Post-migration verification and final checks

* Detailed review of migrated data integrity, including custom fields and plugin data.
* Iterative adjustments and re-runs if needed, within the custom scope.
