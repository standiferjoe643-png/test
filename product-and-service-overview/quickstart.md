# Service Overview

You can think of the three services in terms of who drives the migration and how much customization is needed:

#### Standard Migration (DIY)

* You run the migration tool via the web-based interface.
* Next-Cart provides 24/7/365 support via Helpdesk, Live Chat, and Email.
* Best suited for stores with mostly native platform data and straightforward requirements.

#### Managed Migration (Done-for-you, Standard)

* Next-Cart experts configure and run the standard migration for you (including Demo, Full, and Recent Data Migration), using the same engine as Standard Migration.
* No custom scripts or deep data transformations — only standard entities and standard options.

#### Custom Migration (Done-for-you + Customization)

* Includes everything in Managed Migration, plus Custom Jobs to handle third-party plugins, external files (CSV, XML, XLS, SQL, feeds), special business rules, and complex mappings.
* Best suited for complex or heavily customized stores that rely on external apps, loyalty programs, advanced review systems, or non-standard data structures.

All three services share the same core migration lifecycle:

1. **Demo Migration**
2. **Full Migration**
3. **Recent Data Migration**
