# What Managed Migration Does Not Include

* No custom code to pull data from third-party APIs or external databases.
* No special treatment of plugin data beyond what the standard tool supports.\
  Next-Cart Documentation
* No large-scale restructuring of the Target Store beyond normal mapping.

If, during the Managed Migration planning phase, your case is identified as requiring transformation or plugin data mapping, your project should be upgraded to Custom Migration.
