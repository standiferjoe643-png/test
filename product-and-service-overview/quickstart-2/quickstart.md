# What Managed Migration Includes

Managed Migration includes everything in Standard Migration, plus:

#### End-to-end configuration support

* Connection setup.
* Entity selection and mapping (statuses, customer groups).
* Enabling add-ons like 301 redirects or password plugins (where applicable).

#### Technician-driven execution

* Running the Demo Migration for you.
* Reviewing Demo results together and adjusting settings.
* Running the Full Migration and monitoring logs.
* Handling Recent Data Migration so the final state is in sync at go-live.

#### Post-migration checks

* High-level verification that key entities, relationships, and sample records look correct (e.g., test product, test customer, test order).

Managed Migration **does not** include modifying the tool’s core logic or building custom integrations; that is reserved for Custom Migration.
