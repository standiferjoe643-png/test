# Managed Migration

Managed Migration is Standard Migration operated by Next-Cart on your behalf.

Functionally, it’s equivalent to **“Standard Migration + Manage Service”**.

* You still use the standard migration tool and standard options.
* A dedicated Next-Cart technician configures the migration, runs the Demo and Full migrations, manages any re-runs, and uses Recent Data Migration to sync final changes.
* You receive progress updates and review the results, but you are not responsible for operating the tool step-by-step.
