# How to Choose the Right Service

As a practical guide:

#### Choose Standard Migration if:

* Your store uses mostly built-in platform features.
* You or your agency can comfortably follow technical guides and operate the tool.

#### Choose Managed Migration if:

* Your data is mostly standard, but you lack time or internal capacity to handle the workflow.
* You want Next-Cart to be accountable for setting up and running the standard migration end-to-end.

#### Choose Custom Migration if:

* You rely heavily on third-party plugins or apps (reviews, loyalty, advanced options, digital goods, etc.).
* You need data from external files or systems integrated into your new store.
* You want a single, fully managed project with custom scripts and extensive verification.
